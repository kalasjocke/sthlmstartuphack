        .offset2.span8
          %p Stockholm Startup Hack is a day for developers, designers and innovators living in Stockholm to meet and build things together. We want to put Stockholm on the map as one of the best startup cities in Europe, as well as grow and strengthen our community. We hope that this hackathon can be a small step in that direction.
          %h4 How it works?
          %p Participants will get 12 hours to create something, you can choose to work on your own or in a team (max five people). You can build whatever you want as long as it can stand on its own. We really want to encourage you to make something out of that idea you’ve been saving for later, rather than building something related to your job. Of course, the most important part is that it’s fun and inspiring.
