          %p Participants will get 12 hours to create something, you can choose to work on your own or in a team (max three people). You can build whatever you want as long as it can stand on its own. We really want to encourage you to make something out of that idea youâ€™ve been saving for later, rather than building something related to your job. Of course, the most important part is that itâ€™s fun and inspiring.
          %p The winning team will receive a secret prize, something small but worthy. Spots are limited so apply soon.
          %p We promise to keep you happy all day long with food, drinks, and lots of love. After the hackathon there will be a party further down the street at Tripbirds HQ to celebrate the winners.
