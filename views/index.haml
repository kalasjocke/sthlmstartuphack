            %p STHLM Startup Hack is a day for developers, designers and innovators living in Stockholm to meet and build things together. Our city is one of the most exciting startup hubs in Europe, we want to take part in growing and strengthening our community even more, as well as opening up the world of tech to more people. We hope that this hackathon can be a small step in that direction.
            %h4 How it works?
            %p
              Participants will get <b>12 hours</b> to create something, you can choose to work on your own or in a team <em>(max five people)</em>.
              You can build whatever you want as long as it can stand on its own. We really want to encourage you to make something out of that idea
              you’ve been saving for later, rather than building something related to your job. Of course, the most important part is that it’s fun and inspiring.
              The winning team will receive a secret prize, something small but worthy. The hackathon is <b>free</b> and we promise to keep you happy
              all day long with <b>food, drinks, and lots of love</b>.

            %p
              Want to learn code but don’t know where to start? This is a workshop for you. In parallel to
              STHLM Startup Hack, Ola Möller from <a href="http://www.methodkit.com">MethodKit</a> and Samuel Hedberg from
              <a href="http://www.hyperisland.com">Hyper Island</a> will host
              a workshop about emerging technologies, how to build stuff and the reasoning used when creating apps.
            %p
              This is no lecture, together with the other participants you’ll create ideas for apps & services.
              The idea is to understand the possibilities with technology & to create ideas that can be realized.
              For example, What will become if you combine a step counter, heart rate monitor & Spotify?
              Maybe an app that sync the beats to your pace of walking or an app that pick calming music when we are too stressed.
            %p
              The best idea will be presented along with the winners of the Startup Hack. Sign up now, the seats are limited!
