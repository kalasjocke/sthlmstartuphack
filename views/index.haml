            %p Stockholm Startup Hack is a day for developers, designers and innovators living in Stockholm to meet and build things together. We want to put Stockholm on the map as one of the best startup cities in Europe, as well as grow and strengthen our community. We hope that this hackathon can be a small step in that direction.
            %h4 How it works?
            %p
              Participants will get <b>12 hours</b> to create something, you can choose to work on your own or in a team <em>(max five people)</em>.
              You can build whatever you want as long as it can stand on its own. We really want to encourage you to make something out of that idea
              you’ve been saving for later, rather than building something related to your job. Of course, the most important part is that it’s fun and inspiring.
              The winning team will receive a secret prize, something small but worthy. The hackathon is <b>free</b> and we promise to keep you happy
              all day long with <b>food, drinks, and lots of love</b>.
            %p You have until the <b>14th of April</b> to complete your application. The teams who make it through will be announced shortly after.
            %h4 Let's celebrate!
            %p In connection to the hackathon we will host a party to celebrate Stockholm’s amazing startup community. We will open up the doors to everyone when presentations start. When the winner has been crowned, we will turn the church into a dancefloor with a bar and DJs from different startups.
